# Nodes JS & DevOps project

## Introduction

This is a combined repository for our Node JS and DevOps project.

## Installing

First, clone the project to your local repository.
Then, in order to install all the dependencies :
```bash 
npm install
```

## Running test

You can run tests (developped with mocha and chai libraries)
```bash
npm run test
```
They should all pass !  
To finish the test, just type "ctrl+c" in your terminal.  
And then answer "Y" ("O" in french) to finish the tests.

## Build and populate

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run the project

```bash
npm start
```
You then have to connect yourself to 'localhost:8080/'

## Difficulties
We expressed some difficulties with the d3 library, linking it with our ejs code. Also, the routing methods were difficult to implement for us but we achieve to do it !
